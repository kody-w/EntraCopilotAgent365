================================================================================

CREATED: December 4, 2025
STRATEGY: Show the system managing itself end-to-end
FOCUS: Zero manual work, maximum automation

================================================================================
THE 10 DEMO PROMPTS (Quick Summary)
================================================================================

1. "Boost my AI to the latest model"
   [Automation: IQ Booster discovers models, deploys, updates local+cloud configs]

2. "Set up my agent library with sales team capabilities"
   [Automation: GitHub Library Manager discovers 65+ agents, installs to storage, creates group]

3. "Run our deployment workflow automatically"
   [Automation: Workflow Runner executes JSON transcript, variable substitution, error handling]

4. "Discover what Azure OpenAI resources I have and what models are available"
   [Automation: IQ Booster scans subscription, lists resources, shows quotas, gives recommendations]

5. "Install a custom email agent and enable it just for my team"
   [Automation: Library Manager finds agent, downloads code, installs, creates user group]

6. "Check my current AI configuration and fix any issues automatically"
   [Automation: IQ Booster validates configs, fixes mismatches, reports all changes]

7. "Update all my configuration values to use the new Azure endpoint"
   [Automation: IQ Booster discovers new endpoint, updates prod+dev, restarts function]

8. "Run a workflow to deploy my latest agents and test them"
   [Automation: Workflow Runner executes multi-step deployment, captures test results, error handlers]

9. "Install all agents from the manufacturing vertical and organize them by category"
   [Automation: Library Manager searches category, installs agents, creates organized groups]

10. "Validate and optimize my entire AI infrastructure configuration"
    [Automation: IQ Booster runs comprehensive audit, suggests optimizations, updates parameters]

================================================================================
KEY AUTOMATION PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED
================================================================================

PATTERN 1: DISCOVERY & AUTO-CONFIGURATION (Prompts 1, 4, 6)
- IQ Booster auto-scans Azure resources
- Zero Azure portal navigation
- Auto-applies changes to local + cloud environments

PATTERN 2: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT & INSTALLATION (Prompts 2, 5, 9)
- GitHub Library Manager discovers agents from public repository
- Zero manual downloading
- Auto-registers as callable functions

PATTERN 3: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION & EXECUTION (Prompts 3, 8, 10)
- Workflow Runner reads JSON transcripts
- Zero manual step execution
- Auto-error handling with fallback logic

PATTERN 4: CROSS-AGENT COORDINATION (All Prompts)
- Multiple agents collaborate without user intervention
- Zero manual agent-to-agent communication
- Auto-feedback loops between agent outputs

================================================================================
BUSINESS IMPACT: MANUAL WORK ELIMINATED
================================================================================

Resource Discovery          → IQ Booster auto-scans subscriptions
Azure Portal Navigation     → System finds all resources programmatically
Configuration File Editing  → IQ Booster updates local + cloud configs automatically
Agent Installation          → Library Manager downloads + installs in one call
Deployment Scripts          → Workflow Runner executes JSON with variable substitution
Testing & Validation        → Workflows include built-in test steps
Infrastructure Audits       → IQ Booster runs diagnostic checks automatically
Agent Lifecycle Management  → Library Manager handles versioning, groups, access control
Production Updates          → Configuration changes apply immediately without restarts
Documentation Sync          → System auto-logs all changes to memory

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED DEMO FLOW (For Maximum Impact)
================================================================================

SEQUENCE FOR DEMOS:

1. Discovery (Prompt 4)          → Show system "seeing" Azure resources
2. Auto-Configuration (Prompt 1) → Show model upgrade automatically
3. Library Management (Prompt 2) → Show agent installation from GitHub
4. Workflow Execution (Prompt 3) → Show orchestration of complex processes
5. Comprehensive Audit (Prompt 10) → Show system validating its own config

NARRATIVE: Discovery → Configuration → Integration → Orchestration → Validation

================================================================================
CORE AGENT CAPABILITIES
================================================================================

IQ BOOSTER AGENT:
- Discovers Azure OpenAI resources across subscriptions
- Lists available models without manual lookup
- Provisions new deployments without Azure portal
- Updates Azure Function App settings (production)
- Modifies local.settings.json (development)
- Validates configurations end-to-end
- Suggests model optimizations
- Auto-detects and fixes configuration mismatches

WORKFLOW RUNNER AGENT:
- Parses JSON workflow transcripts
- Variable substitution at runtime
- Multi-step sequence execution with output chaining
- Captures step outputs as variables
- Conditional logic (if/then/else)
- Error handling with on_error blocks
- Foreach loops for bulk operations
- Dry-run mode for previewing changes

GITHUB AGENT LIBRARY MANAGER:
- Discovers all 65+ agents in public repository
- Searches agents by keyword, name, features
- Filters by industry vertical/category
- Downloads code directly from GitHub
- Installs to Azure File Storage
- Creates GUID-based agent groups
- Manages versioning and updates
- Tracks installation history

================================================================================
KEY MESSAGING
================================================================================

"Copilot Agent 365 automates the entire AI infrastructure lifecycle. Your 
agents discover resources, configure themselves, run workflows, and manage 
their own library of capabilities. What used to take hours of manual Azure 
portal clicks and script editing now happens in seconds."

TAGLINE: Zero Manual Configuration. Zero Manual Deployment. Zero Manual 
         Infrastructure Management.

================================================================================
TECHNICAL FOUNDATION
================================================================================

All automation builds on three core agents that orchestrate together:

1. IQ BOOSTER → Discovers & configures Azure resources
2. WORKFLOW RUNNER → Orchestrates complex multi-step processes
3. GITHUB AGENT LIBRARY → Manages agent lifecycle from public repository

Combined with:
- Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) for intelligent routing
- Azure File Storage for persistent memory
- Azure Functions for serverless execution
- Power Automate (optional) for enterprise integration

RESULT: A self-managing AI system that requires zero manual intervention
